Base framework and OS-level infrastructure
##########################################

Cultivation of C++20 programming style
======================================

[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.05#New_tool_chain_based_on_GCC_12.3__C__20_enabled_by_default - One year ago],
we enabled C++20 as default. With the current release, we took the chance to
update the codebase according this version of the standard.

:C++20 function template syntax:
  The 'auto' keyword can be used in many places where template types had to be
  declared manually. We updated all sources of the base framework accordingly.

:Using 'using' instead of 'typedef':
  C-style type aliases are no longer used within the framework.

:/util/geometry.h:
  The header moved from the os to base repository.
  'Point', 'Area', and 'Rect' have been turned into plain compound types,
  making 'x', 'y', 'w', 'h', 'at', and 'area' accessible without a method call.

  'Rect' is now represented as a typle of 'Point' and 'Area', which is the most
  common form of initialization.
  The companion utilities have been updated ('constexpr', eliminating out parameters)
  as well.

:/util/color.h:
  The 'Color' type has been converted from a class to a POD type by replacing
  the constructors by the named create functions 'rgb', 'clamped_rgb',
  and 'clamped_rgba'. It thereby enables the initialization of color
  values using the '{ .r = ... }' syntax and makes the type usable in const
  expressions.

  The change also narrows the type for color components and alpha values to
  'uint8_t'. So possible integer overflows of computed values are detected
  by '-Wconversion'.


Reduced reliance on the C++ exception mechanism
===============================================

In [https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/21.11#New_pattern_for_C___error_handling - version 21.11],
we introduced the 'Attempt' pattern as an alternative to exception-based error
handling. While gradually applying this pattern, in particular for
new introduced interfaces, we observed our code becoming more rigid and
concrete, leaving no condition unconsidered. Given this added assurance,
we are ultimately decided to remove the reliance on C++ exceptions
from the base framework over time. The current release takes a huge leap
in this respect.

:base/id_space.h:
  A new 'Id_space::apply' overload takes a second functor 'missing_fn' as
  argument, which is called whenever the lookup fails.
  It thereby allows the use of the 'Id_space' utility without
  'Unknown_id' exceptions.

:util/xml_node.h:
  The two 'Xml_node::attribute' accessors have been removed along with
  the 'Nonexistent_attribute' exception.
  Attributes are generally accessed via the 'attribute_value' method, which
  handles the case via a default value.

:Core RPC interfaces:
  Exceptions have been entirely removed from the RPC interfaces provided
  the core component, namely 'Trace', 'Pd', 'Cpu', 'Rm', 'Region_map'.

  While touching these interfaces, we took the opportunity for modernization
  and consolidation of both the interfaces and their implementation. E.g.,
  core's trace service received a welcome facelift, the former use of basic
  types got replaced by dedicated types.

  The revised 'Region_map' interface uses an 'Attr' compound struct for
  specifying arguments to the 'attach' operation, which makes the intent of
  client code more obvious. The operation returns a 'Range' instead of a
  'Local_addr' now. The 'Region_map::State' type got renamed to 'Fault'.

:base/child.h:
  The 'Child_policy::Nonexistent_id_space' exception has been removed by
  making the 'server_id_space' mandatory for of each policy.
  The former 'Child::Process' and 'Child::Process::Loaded_executable' classes
  got replaced by static functions that return failure conditions as return
  values, eliminating the use of C++ exceptions by the child framework.

The overall ambition of cutting back the use of C++ exceptions it not limited
to the base framework but can be observed for critical components as well.
In particular, the NIC router received a profound rework in this respect.


Tightened GUI-session interface
===============================

On our [https://genode.org/about/road-map - road map], we anticipated
intensive work on user-facing topics, many being related to graphical user
interfaces. While approaching these topics, we sensed that the clean
implementation of our ideas demands a revisit of the framework's existing GUI
infrastructure, in particular the GUI-session interface as provided by the
nitpicker GUI server and the window manager. Note that we barely touched this
corner of the framework in the past ten years since version
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/14.08#New_GUI_architecture - 14.08].
The changes are as follows.

* The 'Gui::Session::session_control' RPC function got removed because its
  functionality has long been superseded by the window manager/layouter.

* The interfaces and components received a thorough coding-style update,
  embracing C++20, avoiding plain pointers, using 'Attr' structs for passing
  attributes, removing the notion of "invalid" handles/IDs, replacing
  basic types by dedicated types, and removing the use C++ exceptions.

* The out-of-RAM and out-of-caps conditions are now consistently handled by
  the 'Gui::Connection', which does no longer inherit the 'Gui::Session'
  interface and can thereby introduce tailored result types.

* The creation of top-level views and child views are now two distinct
  operations ('view' and 'child_view').

* The access of the subsumed framebuffer and input interfaces is now
  mediated by the plain public members 'Connection::framebuffer' and 'input'.
  This simplifies the client-side code. E.g., '_gui.input()->pending()'
  becomes '_gui.input.pending()'.

* Corner cases of view-stacking operations are now expressed as dedicated
  commands. The new stacking commands are FRONT, BACK, FRONT_OF, and BEHIND_OF.

* View handles are now managed as 'Id_space' and hence named view IDs now.
  The allocation of view IDs has been moved from the server side to the
  client, which gives clients more flexibility and reduces the surface of
  possible error conditions between client and server.
  To ease the client-side ID management, the 'Gui::Connection' hosts
  a 'view_ids' ID space for optional use. E.g., the new 'Top_level_view'
  class uses this ID space for ID allocation. This class accommodates the
  most typical use case of opening a single window.

* The creation of new views accepts initial view attributes now,
  which accommodates typical client use cases with less code.


Fostered consistency of naming
==============================

Within our code base, we are ardent about consistency. However, two relics
from the infancy of the project remained standing out like sore thumbs. First,
the '_drv' suffix of driver executables violated our established
[https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/conventions - style]
of naming things without artificial abbreviations.
Second, the plural naming of the _<repo>/src/drivers/_ directory used to be
inconsistent with the sibling directories _test/_, _app/_, _server/_.
The current release rectifies both inconsistencies. The '_drv' suffix has been
dropped and the directory has been renamed to _driver/_.

Platform driver
===============

During ACPI suspend the PCI bridges in the system may forget their
PCI configuration. On resume this configuration needs to be restored, so that
all PCI devices behind the bridge are usable again. With this release we added
support to pci_decode to report all relevant information, which is
used by the platform driver after an ACPI resume to re-configure the used PCI
bridges.

    hw: move cpu kernel object into cpu local area
    
    Fix genodelabs/genode#5310

NOVA microhypervisor
====================

The kernel received support to handle the x86 CPU FPU extension
[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions - AVX], which is a
family of SIMD instruction extensions which are used for optimized
implementations of mathematical algorithms, e.g. it is used in multimedia
applications. In principle the kernel has to detect the available AVX versions,
e.g. AVX, AVX-2, AVX-512 and depending on it it has to save and restore more
FPU state during thread switching.
Beside the general availability to Genode applications, the Seoul VMM got
enabled as a first user of the feature. The VMM now announces the AVX feature
to the guest VMs, so that the guest kernel can enable it and guest user
applications can utilize it, e.g. for web browser and video de-/coding
use-cases. The feature got tested with Seoul for Intel and AMD systems.

Additionally, the Genode core roottask now supports Intel SOCs with e-Core
only CPUs, formerly named Intel ATOM CPUs and nowadays branded as Intel
n-Series CPUs.

Finally, the kernel now supports the freeing of vCPU related data structures
during VM destruction, got optimized to reduce resource overhead during cross
CPU IPC and improved VM MSR exit handling.

Build system and tools
######################

Improved reproducibility
========================

The demand for reproducible builds has been increasing during the last few
years. The main source that makes builds unreproducible are timestamps. On
Genode especially components that produce TAR files suffered from this
limitation, since the date of the archived data was set to the time of
archiving. To avoid this issue we introduce an overwriteable global TAR_OPT in
Genode's build system that sets the date of the archived files to the date of
the epoch and the user/group to one. As a starting point we added the TAR_OPT to
the Qt5-build process while other targets will incrementally follow.

Additionally, we enabled our Rump port to be reproducible.


Goa SDK
=======

User-level debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the addition of on-target debugging on Sculpt OS in
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.05#On-target_debugging_using_the_GNU_debugger__GDB_ - Genode 24.05],
it was about time to equip Goa with debugging support as well. For this purpose,
the tool received an optional '--debug' command-line switch, which instructs Goa
to consider
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/23.11#Debug_information_for_depot_binaries - dbg archives].
in its download, export and publish steps.

When provided with this switch on 'goa run', the tool also creates a
_<project-name>.gdb_ file in the project's _var/_ directory. This file contains
initialization commands for the GNU debugger (GDB) and can be passed to GDB
via the '--command' argument.

The _Goa testbed_ package and preset have been updated accordingly to make use
of our debug monitor. The default NIC router configuration on Sculpt OS now
comprises an additional _gdb_ domain that is intended to accomodate a single
client to which the router forwards port 9999 of the _uplink_ domain. This is
intended for making the testbed's debug monitor available as a remote GDB target.
Note that these changes will be become effective with the next Sculpt release.
In the meantime, you may cherry-pick the
[https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/commit/aeb42b0983143e6fe0a01f7f5316612709da1a9d - corresponding commit].

Along with debugging support, Goa also received a '--with-backtrace' switch and
a 'backtrace' command. The former instructs the tool to preserve frame-pointer
information by supplying the '-fno-omit-frame-pointer' flag to GCC. The
'goa backtrace' command is a shortcut for 'goa run --debug --with-backtrace' that
additionally passes the log output to our
[https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/24.02#Convenient_parsing_of_backtraces - backtrace tool].

Meson build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projects like Qemu, glib, and Mesa have switched to the Python based
[https://mesonbuild.com - Meson] build system. Mesa, for example, produces a
large number of generated C/C++ files using Meson features. In order to ease the
porting effort of Meson based projects to Genode we have added basic support for
this build system to Goa.

A Meson project can be build and executed like any other Goa supported build
system with the addition that there can be a _meson_args_ file (like
_cmake_args_ for CMake) where additional arguments can be passed to the meson
command. Otherwise, Goa will look for a _meson.build_ file in the _src_
directory which identifies the projects build system as Meson.

As a simple test you can checkout the _hello_meson_ example in the _examples_
directory of Goa.

At the current stage only binary targets for x86_64 systems are supported by
Goa/Meson. Shared libraries and ARM support will be addressed next.

commit 090c810745e2a5e5e20866b9296809813fea0489
Author: Benjamin Lamowski <benjamin.lamowski@genode-labs.com>

    cargo: build Rust projects with a custom profile
    
    The Rust compiler profile for x86_64-unknown-freebsd assumes that thread
    local storage (TLS) is available, and tries the TLS area via the FS
    segment. Since Genode does not provide a TLS area to threads, this will
    result in a nullptr dereference, which showed es segfaults in our test
    programs from Rust 1.77 onward.
    
    Other than implementing x86_64 TLS support throughout our supported
    kernels, this cannot be resolved within the premise of using a
    precompiled stable Rust binary target for x86_64-unknown-freebsd.
    
    Instead, a paradigmn shift is needed: we now compile our Rust software -
    including invoked parts of the standard library - from source, which
    requires a nightly Rust toolchain.
    
    Fixes #101

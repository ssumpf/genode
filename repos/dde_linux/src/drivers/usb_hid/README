USB HID driver
##############

Supports keyboard and mouse connected via USB. It connects to one or multiple
USB sessions and reports input events to an event session. A run script can be
found under 'run/usb_hid_raw.run'.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_hid_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!  <config use_report="yes"/>
!</start>

When the use_report attribute is set, the HID driver will request a ROM called
"report" that is used to iterate over all devices provided by the USB host
controller driver (resp. a rom filter). In that mode the driver tries to
claim all HID devices (class 0x3) via dedicated USB sessions.


Keyboard LED handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The state of the keyboard LEDs like capslock can be controlled by providing
a corresponding ROM to the driver and configure it appropriately:

!...
!<config capslock_led="rom" numlock_led="rom" scrlock_led="rom"/>
!...
